Revision history for Perl extension Hustle::Table

0.5.5 	Wed 17 Aug 2022 15:14:43 AEST
	- Added subroutine matching type. A CODE ref can be used to match the input.
	  Called with the input as the first argument and a reference to the entry value
	  as the second element

	- Fixed bug where default matcher could not be updated with hash or array via
	  the add method. An exuberant croak test/call prevented the adding of
	  an entry when the matcher was 'undef'. An undef matcher actually
	  represents the default matcher (match any). Prior to this fix only
	  explicit set_default method would update default matcher.

	- Fixed documentation around required elements when adding via array
	  ref should take 3 elements. Was listed as 6

	- Reduced scope creation for more performance improvements
	

0.5.4 	Thu 28 Jul 2022 21:40:32 AEST
	- Performance improvements
		- Dispatcher no longer returns an ref to an empty array
		  with non regex matcher types.
		- Removed superfluous scope creation in dispatcher
		- Moved my variable out of dispatcher sub
		
	- Improved dispatch matching performance
		- 1.70x approx for static exact matches
		- 1.15x approx for regex matches
