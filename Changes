Revision history for Perl extension Hustle::Table

v0.7.0 2025-01-11
  [improvments]
    - Now will return multiple matches not just first match
    - Dispatcher will process a list in a single call
    - Will return the default entry only when nothing else matches
    - Significant performance improvments with cached regexp matching
    - Cache is cleared when reusing with multiple calls to prepare_dispatcher

v0.6.1 2023-08-26
  [improvements]
    - Removed use Carp
    - Removed use version
    - Replaced use constant and use enum with use constant::more

v0.6.0  2023-06-07
  [improvements]
    - Regular expressions from non core regexp engines are now processed as a
      regexp directly. Previously these would not be detected, and assumed a
      string to then be compiled into a core regexp
    - Added github actions to repo
  [tests]
    - Added test for regexp matching with a no capture groups
    - Added test for regexp matching with a capture group not capturing
    
  [fixes]
    - captures are now copied into a new array and not a shared array across the table.
    - captures are now returned as per the documentation for regexps with no
      captured items (i.e ref to empty array, instead of undef)
    - Turn off 'not numeric' warnings in main table code to remove noise when
      testing a string input against a numeric matcher

  [pod]
    - Typo fixes.
    - Add a section on new non core Regexp improvements


0.5.5 	Wed 17 Aug 2022 15:14:43 AEST
	- Added subroutine matching type. A CODE ref can be used to match the input.
	  Called with the input as the first argument and a reference to the entry value
	  as the second element

	- Fixed bug where default matcher could not be updated with hash or array via
	  the add method. An exuberant croak test/call prevented the adding of
	  an entry when the matcher was 'undef'. An undef matcher actually
	  represents the default matcher (match any). Prior to this fix only
	  explicit set_default method would update default matcher.

	- Fixed documentation around required elements when adding via array
	  ref should take 3 elements. Was listed as 6

	- Reduced scope creation for more performance improvements
	

0.5.4 	Thu 28 Jul 2022 21:40:32 AEST
	- Performance improvements
		- Dispatcher no longer returns an ref to an empty array
		  with non regex matcher types.
		- Removed superfluous scope creation in dispatcher
		- Moved my variable out of dispatcher sub
		
	- Improved dispatch matching performance
		- 1.70x approx for static exact matches
		- 1.15x approx for regex matches
